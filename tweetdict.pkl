I00
sS'  Recognising a fault as a fault, and what is not a fault as not one, by  holding to right views people go to a good rebirth. 319\n'
p37
I00
sS'  So having clearly understood the value of attention, wise men take  pleasure in it, rejoicing in what the saints have practised. 22\n'
p38
I00

p55
I00
sS'  Even your mother, father or any other relative cannot do you as much  good as your own properly directed thought. 43\n'
p56
I00
sS'  First he should establish himself in what is right. Then if he teaches  others, the wise man will not be corrupted. 158\n'
p57
I00
sS'  Not intimate with laity or monks, wandering about with no abode, and few  needs - that is what I call a brahmin. 404\n'
p58
I00
sS'  The evil he has done himself and which had its origin and being in  himself breaks a fool, like a diamond breaks a precious stone. 161\n'
p59

p62
I00
sS"  A good awakening have ever Gotama's disciples, whose recollection is  always established, day and night on the Teaching. 297\n"
p63
I00
sS'  Where is that man in the world who is so restrained by shame that he  avoids laziness like a thoroughbred horse avoids the whip? 143\n'
p64
I00
sS'  Sandalwood, tagara, lotus, jasmine - the fragrance of virtue is  unrivalled by such kinds of perfume. 55\n'
p65
I00
sS'  Navvies channel water, fletchers fashion arrows, and carpenters work on  wood, but the good disciple themselves. 145\n'
p66
I00
sS'  In the same way that the jasmine drops its withered flowers, you too  should discard desire and aversion, bhikkhus. 377\n'
p67
I00
sS"  A good awakening have ever Gotama's disciples, whose recollection is  always established, day and night on the Buddha. 296\n"
p68

p69
I00
sS'  The good are conspicuous a long way off, like a Himalayan peak, while  the bad are just not noticed, like arrows shot into the dark. 304\n'
p70
I00
sS'  Those who have not lived the holy life, and have not acquired wealth in  their youth, lie like spent arrows, grieving for times past. 156\n'
p71
I00
sS'  Death carries off a man busy picking flowers with an besotted mind, like  a great flood does a sleeping village. 47\n'
p72
I00
sS'  When a man has faith, is endowed with virtue, and possessed of fame and  wealth, wherever he lives he will be honoured. 303\n'
p73
I00
sS'  Blinded indeed is this world. Few are those who see the truth. Like a  bird breaking out of the net, few are those who go to heaven. 174\n'
p74
I00
sS'  Abandoning violence to all living creatures moving or still, he who  neither kills or causes killing - that is what I call a brahmin. 405\n'
p75
I00
sS'  An ignorant man ages like an ox. His flesh may increase, but not his  understanding. 152\n'
p76
I00
sS'  Delightful for them are the forests where men find no delight. The  desire-free find delight there, for they seek no sensual joys. 99\n'
p77
I00
sS'  Weeds are the blight of fields. Desire is the blight of mankind.  Consequently offerings to those free from desire are of great fruit. 356\n'
p78
I00
sS'  He who does no violence to creatures seeking happiness like himself does  find happiness after death. 132\n'
p79
I00
sS'  Elusive and unreliable as it is, the wise man straightens out his  restless, agitated mind, like a fletcher crafting an arrow. 33\n'
p80
I00
sS"  When a man's bad deeds are covered over by good ones, he illuminates the  world, like the moon breaking away from a cloud. 173\n"
p81
I00
sS'  If it ought to be done, then do it; apply yourself to it strenuously. A  lax man of religion just spreads even more dust. 313\n'
p82
I00
sS'  The wise who are restrained in body, speech and mind - such are the well  and truly restrained. 234\n'
p83
I00
sS'  Better than a thousand pointless words is one saying to the point on  hearing which one finds peace. 100\n'
p84
I00
sS"  A good awakening have ever Gotama's disciples, whose minds are always  rejoicing in the practice of meditation. 301\n"
p85
I00
sS'  There is no reaching the unattainable with mounts like these, but with  himself well under control a disciplined man can get there. 323\n'
p86
I00
sS'  Before long this body will be lying on the ground, discarded and  unconscious, like a useless bit of wood. 41\n'
p87
I00
sS'  Guard against physical unruliness. Be restrained in body. Abandoning  physical wrong doing, lead a life of physical well doing. 231\n'
p88
I00
sS'  Happy indeed we live who are free from worry among those who are still  worried. In the midst of worried men, we live free from worry. 199\n'
p89
I00
sS'  Lax behaviour, broken observances and dubious chastity - these are of no  great benefit. 312\n'
p90
I00
sS'  Little by little, moment by moment, a wise man should cleanse himself of  blemishes, like a smith purifying silver. 239\n'
p91
I00
sS'  All fear violence, all are afraid of death. Seeing the similarity to  oneself, one should not use violence or have it used. 129\n'
p92
I00
sS'  In the same way that rain breaks into a house with a bad roof, desire  breaks into the mind that has not been practising meditation. 13\n'
p93
I00

p96
I00
sS"  So understand this, my man - Unrestrained men are evil. Don't let greed  and wrong doing subject you to lasting suffering. 248\n"
p97
I00
sS'  Here and beyond he suffers. The wrong-doer suffers both ways. He suffers  and is tormented to see his own depraved behaviour. 15\n'
p98
I00
sS'  Many of those dressed in the yellow robe are evil and unrestrained, and  the evil end up in hell because of their evil deeds. 307\n'
p99
I00
sS'  Journey over, sorrowless, freed in every way, and with all bonds broken  - for such a man there is no more distress. 90\n'
p100
I00
sS'  Like a cowherd driving cows off to the fields, so old age and death take  away the years from the living. 135\n'
p101
I00
sS'  Look on the world as a bubble, look on it as a mirage. The King of Death  never finds him who views the world like that. 170\n'
p102
I00

p103
I00
sS'  One is not noble if one harms other living creatures. It is by non  violence to all forms of life that one is called noble. 270\n'
p104
I00
sS"  One's own misdirected thought can do one more harm than an enemy or an  ill-wisher. 42\n"
p105
I00
sS'  When a man knows no this shore, other shore, or both - such a one, free  from anxiety, liberated, that is what I call a brahmin. 385\n'
p106
I00
sS'  Freed by full realisation and at peace, the mind of such a man is at  peace, and his speech and action peaceful. 96\n'

p109
I00
sS'  It is a city built of bones, and daubed with flesh and blood, in which  old age and death, pride and hypocrisy are the inhabitants. 150\n'
p110
I00
sS'  From preference arises sorrow, from preference arises fear, but he who  is freed from preference has no sorrow and certainly no fear. 212\n'
p111
I00
sS'  Here and beyond he is glad. The doer of good is glad both ways. He is  glad and rejoices to see his own good deeds. 16\n'
p112
I00
sS'  A man of great immorality is like a creeper, suffocating the tree it is  on. He does to himself just what an enemy would wish him. 162\n'

p118
I00
sS'  When a brahmin has crossed beyond duality, then all the fetters of such  a seer come to an end. 384\n'
p119
I00
sS'  Restraint of the eyes is good. So is restraint of the ears. Restraint of  the nose is good, and so is restraint of the palate. 360\n'
p120
I00
sS'  From pleasure arises sorrow, from pleasure arises fear, but he who is  freed from pleasure has no sorrow and certainly no fear. 214\n'
p121
I00
sS'  If a man disciplines, instructs and restrains them from what is not  right, he will be dear to the good, and disliked by the bad. 77\n'
p122
I00
sS'  By resolution and attention, by discipline and self-control, a clever  man may build himself an island that no flood can overthrow. 25\n'
